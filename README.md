# Android-LED-Controller

This is a simple android application that uses USB Serial communication via Arduino to switch on/off an LED.

The application was made with the help of felHR85's [UsbSerial](https://github.com/felHR85/UsbSerial) library.


Implementation of the application can be found on this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ls4Xe86AB8qFNExaV7M2_rFR0ZT20AA4/view?usp=sharing).
